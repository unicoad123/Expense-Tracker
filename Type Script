1.What advantage does typescript gives us?Explain with example?
PROS
->Optional static typing
->Early spotted bugs
->Predictability
->Readability
->Rich IDE support
->Cross-platform and cross-browser compatibility
CONS
->Not true static typing
->One more JavaScript to learn
->Bloated code
->Adding extra step â€” transpiling

2.What does typescript add to javascript?Explain each of them in your own words. Research on google if you are confused.
->When you have a large codebase
->When you really feel the need for speed
->When a library or framework recommends TypeScript

3.Why do we need typescript compiler?
TypeScript simplifies JavaScript code, making it easier to read and debug. TypeScript is open source. 
TypeScript provides highly productive development tools for JavaScript IDEs and practices, like static checking. 
TypeScript makes code easier to read and understand.

4.What happens when you compile?
A compiler takes the program code (source code) and converts the source code to a machine language module (called an object file). Another specialized program, 
called a linker, combines this object file with other previously compiled object files (in particular run-time modules) to create an executable file.

5.What are the different types available in typescript?
Some common data types in TypeScript are: number , string , boolean , enum , void , null , undefined , any , never , Array and tuple .

6.What do you mean typescript can infer the types? What is the advantage of this?
In TypeScript, there are several places where type inference is used to provide type information when there is no explicit type annotation. 
For example, in this code

let x = 3;
   
let x: number
Try
The type of the x variable is inferred to be number. 
This kind of inference takes place when initializing variables and members, setting parameter default values, and determining function return types.

7.What is the problem with type inferenece sometime and how do you solve with type casting?
